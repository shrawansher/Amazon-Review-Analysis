       "array([ \"Bought this product recently based on recommendations for an advanced math/ scientific calculator.  Apparently, TI has almost all the schools eating out of their hands by having classrooms make these calculators mandatory in many classes.I will say that the calculator features a lot and you can even purchase more applications to dowload at TI's Website.  However, the calculator is complicated to use, and you almost need a course to learn how to use it.  Furthermore, the functionality is poorly designed and if you press a wrong button the calculator will often freeze on you.At the high price for these TI calculators you would think that they would have gotten all the bugs out.  But let me assure you they are definitely there, and you would be better served to get a Casio or HP graphing calculator instead.\",\n",

       "       'I first saw the CANON LS-82z calculator at my local bank.  Itwas anchored to a table, so no one would take it, and wasthere for people to tally up deposits and/or withdrawals. It isso little, so useful, so -- well, cute -- that I found myselfanthropomorphizing it, (that is, turning an innanimate objectinto something which is living...at least in my imagination,and falling completely in love with the adorable littlecalculator at first sight, (and use!). I wanted so much to takeit home with me, (as a calculator -- AND pet!)  Perhaps it\\'sdue to the fact that I live in a no-pet building that helpedfoister these, er....feelings in me, but the fact is that it ISa rather small and compact little calculator, (only 3.5 x 4.5 x1.2 inches in size), has easy-to-use hard, (but not too hard)plastic keys, and a nice big 8-digit display!  It also seemedjust the right size fit in my hand...though, of course, tetheredas it was to the table in the bank, I couldn\\'t try it out.  No --I did NOT hear the little calculator say, \"Take me home with you!\"-- but it was fun to IMAGINE it was saying this.  I also knew thebank had probably searched very carefully to find the right modelcalculator to put on the bank table. So -- with this free advicethat this was a good calculator, (which the bank had unknowinglygiven me -- and every other bank customer!), and my own immediateliking to it -- though I knew I couldn\\'t take the bank\\'s modelhome with me, I did the next best thing: I wrote down the modelnumber, and looked for it on the internet.  Sure enough -- therethe calculator I had seen in the bank, (or maybe one of it\\'sfirst or second cousins!), was there on Amazon!  Immediately, Iliberated....er, that is, bought...two of them, hoping, (in myimagination, that is), that these little calculators would finda happy home in my condo!When the calculators arrived, I took one out of its proteciveplastic casing, and immediately put the number \"107734\" on it.Then I turned the calculator upside down. As with any calculator,the word \"heLLO!\" appeared on the screen.  (There\\'s a whole bookof these calculator tricks, which I mean to look up on Amazonas at the earliest opportunity!)Well, the little Canon LS=82z does fit nicely in the palm of myhand, and works just as well in my home, as it does at thebank.  The keys are HARD plastic -- which means they do NOT getsoft and difficult to use after a while.  However, \"hard\" doesnot mean \"difficult\" here -- the keys are a pleasure to use!They are small enough to keep the size of the calculator down,but big enough for adult hands to use.  And -- this IS a solarAND battery calculator.  You can always test this on any calcu-lator.  Just be sure the calculator is on, and showing numbers.Then put your finger over the solar-battery panel.  If thenumbers fade, then the calculator is a solar-powered calculator,only.  If they do not fade, then obviously a battery is in thecalculator, too -- as is the case here.It\\'s true this calculator has only a three-key memory, and somepeople find this a great inconvenience.  To me, it\\'s only a veryminor inconvenience, and one I can easily live with.  The \"change-sign\" (from plus to minus, or vice versa), key is strangely printedon the same key as \"%\".  Sadly, there seems no way to use the\"change sign\" function, as directions are not given on the back ofthe package, and there are no other directions given.  I don\\'tchange the sign, often -- so again, this is a minor inconvenience,for me.  But if you must change signs from plus to minus, or viceversa, often, I sadlty must suggest you \"adopt\" another calculator.The biggest disappointment, though, is that, although this ISpowered by a battery, (presumably a button model), as well as solarpower, THERE ARE ONLY TWO SCREWS, ON TOP, IN THE BACK OF THECALCULATOR.  This means that it\\'s all but impossible to take thebattery out, and one will be left, eventually, with the choice ofeither using this as only a solar calculator, or getting anothercalculator altogether.  A mean thing to do to both calculator...and user.Still, I plan to use and enjoy my litte LS-82z. And if I anthropor-morphize once in a while, what of it?  Sometime back, an entireTV show, (\\'WONDERFALLS\\'), was based on this idea of anthropormorph-ism.  It stayed on the air only a short time...but during thattime, made money for everyone connected in its production!',\n",
       "       'This item arrived broken. The clear plastic part that acts as a book rest was cracked along the right hand side in two places. It had been wrapped up in cellophane wrap (like Saran Wrap) and then put in a plastic bag. Unfortunately the parts that were broken were rather crucial to its function on the bottom right hand side for tightening.The \"legs\" that hold the clear plastic part weigh about 1 to 2 pounds each, which offers adequate counter balance/support for most books or papers. They rattle, which indicates there is something inside akin to beans or ball bearings, to act as ballast.it comes with one \"bungee\" cord for putting across the book to hold it open.  You can adjust its length to adjust the tension.As usual, I promptly lost the instructions showing how to put it together, so I had to figure it out myself. Looking at pictures of it on the internet helped!  Took me about 15 minutes to get it put together.It is about 18 inches across, and about 11 inches high at its highest point. the tray is about an inch deep, so if you have a book thicker than 2 inches, it\\'s not going to hold that well.Since the one I received was broken, I can\\'t really comment on how sturdy it is. It looks like it cost all of about $10 for the company to make.I like that I can adjust the tray up and down, as well as tilt it forward and backward.  It\\'s a good concept.',\n",
       "       \"I gave it 2 stars because it does not have a warning label.I had purchased this at another store and when I first used it I cut too much off the nozzle and spilled some on a trash bag. My cat started licking at it and had to take her to the vet because the bottle does not have any warning stickers. It turns out that the product is mostly vegetable oil and the worse that I would have to watch for is diarrhea in my cat.The product works really well but it is a danger to pets because of the oil's sweet scent. I'm only buying it again because it works great, is the same price as they other store, and because I now have my shredder protected from my cat. I strongly advise anyone who uses this product to keep their shredder covered if they have pets or something that may be attracted to the oil. Especially if it has an automatic turn on to protect your pet if they put their tongue in your shredder.Update** I was really upset when I tried writing this review.

       "       \"I know, like the first time I saw a Rubik's cube, I just sat and stared at this thing for about five minutes to figure out how it works. At first, I thought I received the wrong shipment: I thought this was some sort of unpopular female grooming device.  I called Amazon customer support and a really smart agent, Hareesh, told me how to use it.  Many thanks, Hareesh from New Delhi.It works by gripping the staple with those jaw-like teeth, then this device gently plucks staples out of paper.  Already used staples loosen their pincer grip on the paper, and fall out like thin metal whiskers from a giant robot or something.  The staples, alas, cannot be re-used. A suggestion for a future version of this device would be to somehow crimp the staple when it's being withdrawn from the paper to be re-used in some fashion.  That would make the device more ecologically friendly.  I took a star off my rating because if even I, who has been using this now for about three minutes, can think of ways to make it better, then something is definitely wrong in Who-ville. Plus the fact that it only comes in one color, black.  I think a rainbow of colors would be reasonable and would make this a focal point of the desktop.  For instance, I would have chosen fuschia, if it was a choice.All in all, though, it gets the job done.  It takes staples out of paper.  I stopped using my toenail clippers to get staples out of papers now.  I wish it had a letter opener and maybe a Scotch tape dispenser build in...or better yet, a stapler!  The pulled out staples could somehow go back into the stapler and be reused on the spot, you know, like when you put the staple in at a funny angle and you wish you could re-do it.  Well, you could, if my idea works.  If the manufacturer wants to take my ideas and run with them, that's fine, I don't need any money.  You can just name it after me.\",\n",

       "       'The Avery 8395 labels -- generically called name badges -- are outstanding in both features and price.  Following are four pluses and two minuses.+ + + STICKYAt the Kansas City, Missouri, affiliate of Habitat for Humanity, where I\\'ve been volunteering on construction job sites since 1997, we all wear name tags.  These tags are merely strips of duct tape written on with a marker, and I can tell you from all those years of experience that they fall off pretty readily when applied to clothing that then endures several hours of twisting and turning and stretching and contracting and pulling and -- don\\'t forget -- sweating.This product withstands all those problems, so you can imagine how much better it will withstand the rigors of, say, your typical business seminar where the guests wear business suits, unless your business seminars frequently include guests wearing overalls and do-rags and muscle shirts and construction boots and tool belts.These Avery 8395 name badges stay stuck.  Let me tell you how I know.  Yesterday afternoon I attached one to a t-shirt and then here\\'s what I did:== Mowed the lawn and did some other yard work, enough to work up a sweat== Wrestled with our 70-pound dog for a while== Rode my motorcycle for half an hour, at one stretch reaching 70 miles per hour (in a 35 mph zone)== Just to see what would happen, I literally scrunched the badge and the fabric underneath it; at first I scrunched pretty lightly, but then I scrunched pretty darned much, a total of maybe half a dozen scrunches altogether== Removed the badge and replaced it== Doffed the shirt and re-donned it== Finally, I slept in the shirt.Then I took the photograph I\\'ve added to the Amazon listingAvery Adhesive Name Badges, 2.33 x 3.375 inches, White, Pack of 160 (08395)for these Avery 8395 labels.  As you might not be able to tell, so I will tell you, except for a couple of light crinkles the badge is pristine, because the material it\\'s made of, which I assume is some sort of plastic, is more flexible and thus less likely to crease than paper.  It wants to conform to the shape of the clothing it\\'s attached to no matter how that shape changes.But what\\'s more impressive is that it\\'s still stuck securely to my t-shirt.  After all the grief I put it through, it should have given up and fallen off at SOME point, but it never did.Later: I started another test.  I thoroughly soaked a portion of a different t-shirt with water, and then I applied another of these badges, which I think must be an extreme test.  As of now, an hour later, the badge is firmly planted on my chest, and the fabirc is still faintly wet.And now it\\'s the next day and I\\'ve slept wearing the second badge, and I\\'ve also scrunched it roughly a few times, and I\\'ve also removed it and replaced it twice (no, no wind test or dog-wrestling this time), and it is still stuck quite nicely, thank you.To reiterate, this name badge stays stuck really well.+ + + STURDYAnd not only does it stick well, it\\'s also really sturdy.You literally can\\'t tear these badges apart with your fingers without considerable effort.  If a normal paper badge can be torn with X amount of shear force, these badges won\\'t tear till you\\'ve applied maybe 20 times that X amount.  I estimate that 50% of your average grandmothers literally could not tear one of these badges in half.  The plastic film strongly resists efforts to rip instantly in twain and instead merely deforms, which I assure you, even if I can\\'t describe it well, is less catastrophic.+ + + WRITING SURFACEThe front face, the one you write on, feels slicker than paper and seems to be perfect for writing on with a marker; it has just the right texture or the right finish or something.+ + + TWO-WAY REMOVALThis product offers yet another handy feature -- two-way removal -- which is clever.  Expensive, I\\'m sure, but no less clever.In one scenario you, the badge-monkey, use some sort of broad-stroke marker to write in the guest\\'s name on a badge and then remove it from the backing and hand it, sticky-side down, to that guest, at which point the next move pretty much has to be that that guest applies it to his or her clothing right then and there.  And you can do that with this product as well, if you remove the badge from the FRONT of the sheet as is normal.But if you remove it from the back of the sheet you get a different result.  The result is a separate badge with its backing still attached.  This means you also have the option of merely handing out those self-contained badges, presumably along with a marker, to guests as they arrive.  They can then do the writing and then the removal of the backing (and then the application to their clothing) themselves, and they can do it at their leisure, after putting down their Blackberries and their briefcases.Another option, of course, is for you, the badge-monkey, simply to remove a whole bunch of these badges from the backs of the sheets and lay them out on a table or a counter and direct your guests to them.- - - PRICEAs I think I prove below, no matter how you measure it per inch these name badges are expensive, so you should decide whether they are worth it.  (Prices vary over time, so keep that in mind if you are reading this long after I wrote it, which is April 10, 2011.)At 10 cents per yard, 2-inch duct tape costs $0.009375, or just under a penny, for a name tag that\\'s 3-3/8 inches wide.  At, say, $25 per 400, these Avery 8395 badges, which are cut to that same 3-3/8 inches in width, cost $0.0625 each, which is 6-2/3 times more expensive.  If you account for the fact the badges are 2-1/3 inches high instead of only 2 inches, they\\'re still 600% more expensive than the same acreage of duct tape.Perhaps a more useful point of comparison, unless you\\'re supplying rough, tough Habitat for Humanity volunteers with name tags, is that one model (Avery Border Name Badge Labels, Red, Pack of 100, 2.34 x 3.375 Inches (5140)) of Avery\\'s plain badges of the same dimensions is available on Amazon for, let\\'s say, 3-1/2 cents each, which still makes the fancier Avery 8395 model nearly 80% costlier.(If I got any of that math wrong, please leave a comment.)- - - FORBIDDEN SURFACESAside from these name badges\\' high price, a drawback is the fact the manufacturer warns, \"Do not apply to vinyl, plastic, leather, suede, velvet, curduroy, silk or other delicate fabrics.\"  I want to know what happens if you do, but I\\'ve run enough tests already on these Avery 8395 badges, don\\'t you think?',\n",

Insipidly white, without so much as the adorning blue speckled lining used when mailing things of discretion, these pretended to portend nothing more than a letter. All my uncles were either poor or healthy, and none were with the kind of fondness required to entreat me to riches upon their earthly demise.These simple #10 envelopes carry the most ordinary contents. Mine, the one sent to me, carried one piece of paper, a news clipping. A friend from years back sent it to me. His address was written in a sharp India ink in the top left corner, with his initials, PS. My name and address was written in blue, slightly to the right of center. There was no note. None was needed. The clipping was curse enough.The clipping was short. She was married, it said, to an otherwise good man, in early October amidst the autumn colors in a church just south of where I used to live. I don't remember his name. Hers is emblazoned on my soul.Why I left that town I cannot say. Why she stayed I never knew. What remains is space between us and in my heart, neither of which can be reduced by returning there. The church I knew well, finding there once the solace of quiet and of God. I have not found such peace since.Offered here are 100 envelopes. The seal is not always secure, and the box does not always close neatly, small features for some, but missing that five-star quality. Suitable for office needs, and better used as such than for mailing newspaper clippings of lost loves to old friends who will sit and mumble and muse about how empty the envelope now feels.--Brockeim\",\n",

       "       'When compared to other printers, the 860 fares very well in some respects. It produces photo prints that are closest to those that you would get from store processing. It also does quite a good job with text. It merits its \"best buy\" status.But is any printer really a \"best buy\" for photo printing when compared to photo processing? To get store-quality prints with the 860 you need Canon\\'s best paper. And when you use that paper the prints cost far more than store processed prints, but you get nothing more for your expense than immediacy. So, if you need an instant print perhaps it is worth the extra, but the additional cost of printing from the 860 versus taking your memory card to the local store could be immense if you take a lot of photos.In a couple of important respects the 860 prints you get even with Canon Photo Paper Pro are inferior to processed pics. If you bend the Pro paper you will not just get a crease in the paper, you will also get a pronounced line in the photo itself, and it doesn\\'t take much of a bend to cause this. It is also very easy to scratch the surface of the prints. So, they are much more easily damaged than conventional photos. Also, the independent company that does the testing for print longevity has found that the Canon prints will only last about 25 years, while those of HP and Epson will last more than 75 years. Many people want pictures they can save for their grandchildren (or \"posterity\"), and the Canon prints apparently won\\'t meet that desire.Canon supples software that you need to utilize all print features. This consumes more time and reduces efficiency. (At least on a Mac.) Even using the printer tray, the pictures are not properly centered if you choose to have borders. There is more white space on some sides than others, so I consider that option useless.Most people rate this printer compared to other printers. I prefer to compare it to other real-world options. In that respect it only does so-so. I prefer not to pay considerably more for prints that are no better than I can get by waiting for 60 minutes at a store, or sending them via the internet and picking them up at my leisure.',\n",

At first, I thought I received the wrong shipment: I thought this was some sort of unpopular female grooming device. I called Amazon customer support and a really smart agent, Hareesh, told me how to use it. Many thanks, Hareesh from New Delhi.It works by gripping the staple with those jaw-like teeth, then this device gently plucks staples out of paper. Already used staples loosen their pincer grip on the paper, and fall out like thin metal whiskers from a giant robot or something. The staples, alas, cannot be re-used. A suggestion for a future version of this device would be to somehow crimp the staple when it's being withdrawn from the paper to be re-used in some fashion. That would make the device more ecologically friendly. I took a star off my rating because if even I, who has been using this now for about three minutes, can think of ways to make it better, then something is definitely wrong in Who-ville. Plus the fact that it only comes in one color, black. I think a rainbow of colors would be reasonable and would make this a focal point of the desktop. For instance, I would have chosen fuschia, if it was a choice.All in all, though, it gets the job done. It takes staples out of paper. I wish it had a letter opener and maybe a Scotch tape dispenser build in...or better yet, a stapler! The pulled out staples could somehow go back into the stapler and be reused on the spot, you know, like when you put the staple in at a funny angle and you wish you could re-do it. Well, you could, if my idea works. If the manufacturer wants to take my ideas and run with them, that's fine, I don't need any money. You can just name it after me.\",\n",

More specifically, I am the only member of my household who does the vast majority of ordering with the company and I, just little ole\\' me, turn in 30-90 orders a month with the company. Not all of them are huge, but that is not what is important. It is of interest because as one person, who orders mainly for herself including general family needs,  with the additional occasional \"Hey Honey, don\\'t forget to order me  that Purple Marlin Spinning Bait I happened to see in that special Warehouse sale that ends in 42 more minutes, you know, just sayin\\'\", I post a LOT of orders with this Company. Going to Targets or Wahlmart has come to seem like an awful nuisance. I have better things to do with my time. Sleeping is always an attractive option.But really, I order most of the family and household general needs from Amazon. Subscribe and Save has become a way of life.But, as with any systme where ordering sight unseen is involved, things go askew from time to time. I used to be the old gal who repacked things with a ton of Scotch plastic tape which is really meant for Christmas presents. Then I would go dig out hubby\\'s Masking tape. When that was gone, I used that heavy duty stuff that is generally used to hold pipes in place.Finally, I got a clue. If you order, you will have to send back. Amazon sends things out in tidy little boxes with air filled  little plastic packing protectors which are JUST PERFECT for returning that lovely decorative, metal, orange polka dot and turquoise colored Gecko wall decoration that the five year old was Just Certain Grampa would like on the wall in his hunting lodge in Ontario. Keep in mind that dear old dad was here to push the button when that order went through!?! So, there must be a way to tape these mishaps back into their original packing boxes without resorting to the use of the Christmas Scotch Tape.Having learned to whip around the Amazon site at the speed of light, I zoomed right over to \"Packing Tape in Office Supplies.\" I automatically hit the Prime button and went on my search. Bingo. This pack of six Heavy Duty Packaging Tape Rolls popped right up. I also had the option of getting LARGE rolls of tape and purchasing a GUN to hold the tape to use for my return needs. But, I am NOT THAT BIG an Amazon shopper. Besides, I might forget what that GUN was for and take my hostilities out on that Purple Marlin Lure. So, I ordered the box of six rolls of tape which are two inches wide. They come with their own little red plastic holder so that I do not have to sign up for Gun safety lessons at the local rifle range.Six Rolls Of Tape. Tape held in a small red plastic holder. Snap the small cardboard piece out of the way so that the tape can roll. Print your return labels. One goes in the package. No tape required here. The other label goes ON THE OUTSIDE OF THE BOX in which the returning item was originally shipped in. Carefully close the box after making certain that 1. The item originally ordered in carefully packed back in the box. 2. CHECK AND MAKE ABSOLUTELY CERTAIN that label Number one is packed with the item being returned. 3. Hold the box carefully so that all the edges make contact and no open spaces remain at the top of the box. 4. Cut label number 2 as indicated on your computer print out. 5. SECURELY FASTEN LABEL NUMBER TWO TO THE TOP OF THE BOX. This means using more than one strip of tape. If the thin little computer paper label rips because YOU were stingy with tape, then YOU are the one who loses a refund when the entire box ends up in the LOST FILE with UPS or the Post Office. (I wonder if those guys get all of last year\\'s lost packages at Christmast time?...well...a Government Agency would absolutely not stand for that sort of thing, but it is an interesting concept!) Anyway, 5. Tape outer label appropriately. 6. Make certain that no old labels are still hanging around so that the delivery guys can get confused and send that lovely Gecko back to you. 7. Put your tape away. 8. Make certain that you always have enough tape on hand to return any unwanted, broken, or unidentifiable items that you receive from Amazon.Well, you can see how I make use of this Scotch Heavy Duty Paking Tape. I order and I send back. Occasionally, I actually order something and send it to someone anew; that is, from myself. I have two friends who live in Viet Nam. Not too many companies are jumping up and down to post packages to them. So, I get out the trusty tape and do it myself. I love the stuff. It is just the right size for me to use without getting that Gun thing and shooting myself in the foot. I do order this using the S & S option because between returning items...properly packaged, and sending things to others, I use about six rolls every six months. Amazon does not make many mistakes with its orders and I try not to change my mind about things all the time, so six rolls is quite sufficient for our family needs. It is small and simple to store. I have a little area in a drawer where I keep my batteries and small light bulbs. My packing tape and other types of tape all fit in the one big drawer. The tape holds boxes together well and gets the box where it is going. That should be about it. I buy the tape. I use the tape. It works well and performs as it says it will. It is priced optimally for my needs considering that it is delivered to my front door every six months. I am very pleased with this deal. Great tape that works just as it should.Sign up and check it out for youself. If you are not happy with this, get one of those tape  gun thingies and shoot yourself in YOUR foot. Seeeee.....Told you. YOU DO like this tape. I\\'m so glad you gave it a try. Ho Ho. I must be getting really tired. The tape is good and I hope you try it and like it. Have a good one shipping your trusty dusty packages held together with Scotch. Cindy O.',\n",

And yet it's Windows that's supposedly so inferior?Anyway, this is a terrific machine for the money, and being able to have access to equipment like this is part of the reason I put up with Windows (and I am a determined Vista-avoider for the same reason I have no interest in a Mac).Printing is plenty fast for SOHO use. First page is 10-12 seconds when you're running out the door. The duplexer actually works -- though it's too slow for high volume. And the sheet feeder actually works! Just a sheet fed scanner this good could cost $300 or $400.The Canon drivers and software (for XP, anyway) are reliable and powerful.The killer feature, to me, is that I can put a stack of paper documents in the sheet feeder, push one button, and a multipage pdf lands on my (Windows) desktop. That by itself makes my day at tax time. SOHO folks can use this to scan receipts and other paperwork and eliminate a lot of paper filing.There's really nothing not to like.

       "       \"I know, like the first time I saw a Rubik's cube, I just sat and stared at this thing for about five minutes to figure out how it works. At first, I thought I received the wrong shipment: I thought this was some sort of unpopular female grooming device. I called Amazon customer support and a really smart agent, Hareesh, told me how to use it. Many thanks, Hareesh from New Delhi.It works by gripping the staple with those jaw-like teeth, then this device gently plucks staples out of paper. Already used staples loosen their pincer grip on the paper, and fall out like thin metal whiskers from a giant robot or something. The staples, alas, cannot be re-used. A suggestion for a future version of this device would be to somehow crimp the staple when it's being withdrawn from the paper to be re-used in some fashion. That would make the device more ecologically friendly. I took a star off my rating because if even I, who has been using this now for about three minutes, can think of ways to make it better, then something is definitely wrong in Who-ville. Plus the fact that it only comes in one color, chrome. I think a rainbow of colors would be reasonable and would make this a focal point of the desktop. For instance, I would have chosen fuschia, if it was a choice.All in all, though, it gets the job done. It takes staples out of paper. I wish it had a letter opener and maybe a Scotch tape dispenser build in...or better yet, a stapler! The pulled out staples could somehow go back into the stapler and be reused on the spot, you know, like when you put the staple in at a funny angle and you wish you could re-do it. Well, you could, if my idea works. If the manufacturer wants to take my ideas and run with them, that's fine, I don't need any money. You can just name it after me.\",\n",

       "       'You place one or more objects inside the clear plastic pouch and then run the pouch through the GBC HeatSeal QuickStart H320 Pouch Laminator (model 1703000).  The device uses heat to slightly melt the two sheets of the pouch and then the device uses pressure to press them tightly together.  The resulting flat piece of plastic with your object inside is now essentially a single unit.  The plastic protects the object against moisture and crud and wear and tear, and because the plastic is transparent you can see both sides of whatever\\'s inside.Things TO laminateSome things are just begging to be laminated.  Here\\'a my list so far.-- A \"Pitch Card,\" about 2 inches by 3 inches, that shows on it lots of information about roof pitches and angles.  The tables and formulas, which I custom-wrote for use on Habitat for Humanity job sites, is handly but you need to carry it around in a tool belt, so unless it\\'s laminated or in some other way protected it will get wrecked in no time.  Laminating it is a perfect solution.  According to the manufacturer the 1703000 accepts objects up to 12.5 inches, so I did four cards at once.-- Recipes, mine of which are on 4-inch by 6-inch index card stock.  If a recipe meets the following criteria it is a good candidate for laminating:(1) It\\'s a recipe you make often enough that it\\'s worth the time and expense of laminating the card it\\'s on;(2) You don\\'t already have the recipe memorized;(3) Making the dish is likely to get the card filthy.For example, I made yet another complicated batch of spaghetti sauce yesterday, this time with Gavin, who is 12 and not all that careful about how clean his hands are.-- A card I attach to the inside of one of my motorcycle\\'s saddlebags that tells the gasoline requirements of the bike and the toll-free number of Suzuki Motorcycles and the phone number and address of my local shadetree bike mechanic, Richard.-- Speaking of which, a similar but smaller card showing the gasoline and oil requirements for the lawn mower, and a similar card for the weed whacker, which I atteched to those machines so I don\\'t have to find the manuals.-- My A.C.L.U. card.  It\\'s a cheap temporary version on lightweight card stock, that I\\'ve carried around in my wallet for so long, since 1986 according to the now barely legible date in the upper right corner, just so I can say I\\'m \"a card-carrying member of the ACLU.\"  That\\'s from a song, right?-- Speaking of which, the Bill of Rights, which I formatted and printed onto a wallet-size card that I can now carry around snuggled up next to my ACLU card.  I like number 1 the best, I have little use for number 3, and I find number 4 the most interesting.Well, you get the idea.  There are probably many objects in your life you would laminate if you thought to and had a way of.  You can get stuff laminated professionally at businesses such as Kinko\\'s, but if you have a laminator in your home or office or kayak you can save a trip.  (Note: Kayak must be equipped with 120-volt 60 Hz AC power.)Things NOT to laminateThe list of objects that can\\'t or at least probably shouldn\\'t be laminated is distressingly long.  In the interest of offering a thorough review of this product I have attempted to laminate quite a variety, and I list below, in the order in which I tried them, some of the ones that didn\\'t seem to work right.-- A bowling ball.  Your standard-issue bowling ball is required to have a circumference of -- as if you didn\\'t know -- no less than 26.704 inches and no greater than 27.002 inches.  According to my math -- and you should feel free to check it but I\\'m pretty sure it\\'s the circumference divided by pi -- that means a diameter of from roughly 8.500147201 inches to approximately 8.595003547 inches.  If I may be permitted to round conservatively, let\\'s call it 8.54 inches.Remembering that the product under review boasts a width of 12.5 inches, you will see that the diameter of a bowling ball is exactly 31.68 percent smaller.  Despite such a large clearance, a bowling ball does not laminate successfully.-- Two bowling balls.  Yes, I do realize now, as I type this review weeks later, what I probably should have realized back when I was conducting this test: If one bowling ball won\\'t fit, two probably won\\'t either.-- Your hamster.  After seeing (and, for the first few moments, hearing) the results, I have decided it\\'s too upsetting to some readers of Amazon reviews to go into the details, so I hope you will just take my word for it that you should not use the H320 to try to laminate your hamster.-- Your own finger.  Nowhere in the instruction manual is there a warning against trying to laminate your left pinky finger, and I\\'m not saying you would necessarily ever want to laminate any fingers whatsoever, but I am saying that if you DO end up mistakenly laminating your left pinky finger, you might end up filing a massive lawsuit for millions of dollars just as I have.Used in the expected ways, the 1703000 is imperfect.  Larger documents sometimes come out with bends in them, which mars their value as presentation pieces if that\\'s what you want.  The warm-up time is underaggerated, but you can solve that problem by turning it on sooner.This is an adequate home-office laminator if you need one just often enough and don\\'t expect perfection.',\n",

They look EXACTLY the same to me, except that oen gives it\\'s item number as Hs-8Va, and one as HS-8VA.  Does more capitalization for the item number mean more expense....or less?At any rate, the Casio HS-8VA calculator I have before me, is a neat little machine.  The 8 digits show up dark and clear in the number window -- which is my own preferred style of \"picture frame\", (wherein the number window has its own, protective shield), rather than the \"wrap-around windshield\" style, wherein the number window is protected by the same plastic that envelopes the rest of the calculator.  The \"picture frame\" style, is more immediate and feels more accessable...or so it seems to me.This calculator has a nice, \"continuing constant\" feature -- very helpful for those making calculations needing a constant!  The red \"C/CA\" key with it\\'s own nice little frame, acts as a \"clear\" key, a \"clear entry\" key, and an \"all clear\" key, all at once.  Very handy and space saving!This calculator has both a \"square root\" key, and a \"change sign\" key, which both come in very handy for mathematical calculations.  It also has a larger, a \"percentage\" key -- which is OK by me, but also seems sort of a luxury.  I have always considered the \"percentage\" key somewhat superflous, you see, because, I have found, one can easily figure percentages out without a percentage key!  (7% of 100 ======  7 , division key , 100 , equal key , (.07, answer)  Etc.  So, it\\'s nice to have a % key....but not necessary.  I would have preferred the \"%\" key to be smaller, and the \"square root\" key bigger....but this is a very, very minor quibble.This calculator has a 3-key memory, which can be a bit inconvenient, (but I can live with it.)  The thing I find MOST inconvenient about this calculator, though, are the somewhat smallish keys. Although I have very small hands, and can easily depress them, they are nowhere near as spacious as some other calculators I have had of this size.  NOT that these keys are SO small that it\\'s impossible to press them...it\\'s just that one has to be more careful and precise depressing the keys here.  (Somewhat making up for this is the metal, (or at least, metallic-looking plastic) that comprises the outside housing of this calculator.  It is a very handsome calculator to look at!)Also, the \"minus\" sign, when it appears, does NOT appear to the left, (or even the right) of the number.  For, in order to make the numbers themselves nice and large, and easily readable, the minus sign, when showing, appears, (accompanied by the word \"minus:), ABOVE the numbers, on the Left side of the number window.  When the \"Error\" sign appears, it is also ABOVE all the numbers....on the Right side of the number window.  As the numbers themselves, these \"minus\" and \"error\" signs are nice and dark and clear......but their above-the-numbers placement, (which I, at least, have found in no other calcuclator), does take some getting used to.This calculator stays on for about 8 1/2 minutes, which is a nice, long time forany calculator! : )The calculator has two-way power, and a nice large solar-battery window, (also, delightfully, in a separate, \"picture-frame\" setting.)  On the back, it\\'s mentioned that this calculator takes one LR54 battery, (and, I assume, any equivalent).  There is only one screw showing in the back,...so I don\\'t know how easy it is to replace the battery.It\\'s somewhat ironic and amusing to me, that this calculator, though produced by the \"Casio Computer Company, Tokyo Japan\", is listed as \"Made In China\" (!)  Those of us old enough to remember the decade or so right after World War II, (baby-boomers and older), when EVERYTHING seemed to be \"Made In Japan\". will, as I did, probably look twice at this inscription on the back of the calculator.  Time does march on!  I don\\'t remember if many sub-standard goods came out of Japan in those post-WWII days...but I do know that, sadly, many sub-standard goods seem to be coming out of (Communist) China these days.  However, not ALL goods coming out of (Communist) China these days are sub-standard.  Some, in fact, are very, very well made.  This Casio HS8-VA calculator is DEFFINITELY one of the better-made products coming out of (Communist) China right now.  It is a winner in size, appearance, and calculating ability.  A nice-looking, basic+ calculator, that is very light, easily-carried in anyone\\'s pocket or purse!  : )',\n",

Plus we wanted a more flexible voice menu system.Adding just 1 or 2 more land lines was going to cost quite a bit more per month, so we started looking at VoIP options.After much research, we found the 200 Series IP PBX system by voiSip.  Wow.It supports unlimited extensions, which can be corded, cordless, and even remote (great for working from home).It also supports up to 32 simultaneous calls, right out of the box.  Just upgrade your voiSip plan as needed.The biggest advantage was being able to save a TON of money by using voiSip's multi-line voip plans, instead of land lines.Call Recording, Call Monitor, Call Whisper and Call Barge are other great features we use a lot.The 200 Series does cost about 399 bucks, but it gives us a corporate level system at a small business price.

       "       'Bought this printer on Ebay.  New never opened box arrived.  It is a big printer physically.  Put it across the room from computer using a long cord connnector.  Already had Pixma iP4000 which printed nice 8.5x11\".  Difference in quality obvious.  Will be using Canon Classic II gloss paper.  When ink gets low I will refill for a fraction of Canon ink.  There are high end ink suppliers on the web with instructions.Been using Elements 7.  Bought a new computer and decided to try Google Picasa3 which is free.  So far I like it better than Elements 7 on last computer.  May not download to new computer Picasa3 is so simple to use.  Easy editing and printing to the 9000MkII.  Want to mention I bought the Iomega 1TB portable HD which I used to transfer thousands of pics from old to new computer.  New computer has Windows 7.  Like it generally.  Easier with digital pics for me than Windows XP.Need to mention cameras because they effect print quality.  Lots of my files have pics from my Canon SX10 IS.  A year ago I bought the Canon 40D and five lens mostly on Ebay.  Three of the lens are \"L\" type which are among the best IMHO.  Two are one step down but still excellent the 50MM 1.4 and 10 to 22mm 3.5 both by Canon.  Also read some popular books on photography by Peterson and Scott Kelby.  Among the helpful ideas they taught me was the use of a tripod or monopod for ALL pics if possible.  Canon Pro9000MkII prints are much better from 40D pics even through each original pics has close to same megapixals, 8mp verses 10.Cameras share some attributes with astro telescopes.  In fact digital photos started with telescopes.  Telescopes have a much harder time getting good pictures due to low light, extreme distance, and earth rotation, etc.  To overcome these difficulties \"good\" telescope pictures require STEADY MOUNTS (i.e. tripod) and good glass (like Legacy).Everyday digital camera pics can be hand held without a tripod and one unchangeable fixed or zoom lens.  BUT if you want to go to the NEXT LEVEL.  Get a good tripod with a good ballhead and put a good camera on it that uses superior glass.  Superior glass starts around $500 (prime lens) and for the zooms about $1000 and go higher.  One of them most popular Canon L glass zooms is $1600.  With the Canon 40D or current 50D at around $1200.  This next level is expensive.Taken pictures all my life and studied the technicals about exposures etc.  Higher end digital cameras like the changeable lens Canons and Nikons cost upwards of $750 with QUALITY lens have many features that are not easy to use without some serious effort to learn how.  Perhaps many just use the \"AUTO\" settings.  Fine for them.  If your do your homework, I needed a couple supplimental instructions manuals for my Canon 40D, you can begin taking pics that allow cropping and large prints with amazing clarity.  Often one manual unclear but with the second manual comparisons learned about hundreds of options that can be programmed into camera for specific types of photography, ref: mirror lockup, white balance, full program, live view, etc.  Different lens allow specific pics advantages.  Peterson\\'s books excellent on this.Photo editors like Picasa3 make it pretty easy to take medium quality pics and crop to gems within.  Try all the tools back and forth to see what looks more pleasing.  Perhaps ONE PERCENT of original pics are perfect as taken.  The other ninety nine percent can be improved with editing, IMHO.  All the equipment described above will give you original pics of such high quality there is plenty of room for editing.  Proof me for is the difference between pics from the Canon SX10 IS and the Canon 40D with the Legacy lens and this Canon Pixma Pro9000Mk II.Every time you move a digital pic in your computer you will loose some detail.  When you take the pic and store it on you computer you already have lost quite a bit unless you use RAW format.  All those megs used for each pics which the cameras advertise can be misleading if you fail to realize how reduced the pics are when you transfer off the original camera storage card and then move to digital processors and CROP and edit etc. Pro9000MkII prints with such sharpness that you need all the quality in the original you can manage.If you take quality pics and edit well the Pro9000MkII will give you some prints that made me appreciate why taking the pics about half the process of creating beautiful pictures.  The other half is making large beautiful prints you hang on your walls for years of enjoyment.  My friends have been \"WOW\\'d\" by the prints from this Pro9000MkII.  I have been offered hundreds to take some pet pictures for friends and print them based on some pics of our Golden Retriever \"ARROW\".Take good pictures and this Canon Pixma Pro9000MkII will bring back the moments they were taken plus some WOW!UP DATE:  Lots of bueatiful prints later couple ink cartridges running out.  Using a refill system with chip resetter.  So easy if I have to fill one I top off any others that are low even if they have not shown refill blinking light.  No clogging problems.  Giving lots of pics to friends taken at get togethers.  Good practice photography and they really like the super quality.  This printer is the other half of a quality digital camera for someone who wants large and small quality prints.',\n",

The first of them is that my laptop wasn't able to recognize the software that came with the HP Printer. It was very difficult to install after a few times, so I had to deal with their customer service for constant help. Second, the other problem I had is that I couldn't put too many sheets of paper into the printer slot, because there were too many paper jams, that ultimately shut the printer down.

It\\'s been about two weeks now, and it\\'s been downhill steadily.On day 1, I found out that despite their claims of portability, Ooma could not port my phone number.  Moreover, despite their claims of being able to provide a number within my calling area, they couldn\\'t do that either.  I settled for a completely \"alien\" number.  I also learned that it is not free service.  State taxes on phone service must be paid each month regardless of having the Ooma system, and a great many of the Ooma features are available only with their $10/month Premier service.On day 2, Ooma began sending all my calls to voice mail without giving me a chance to answer.  It also cut off the caller, so they were unable to leave a message.  I contacted Ooma support; they adjusted the software and had me reboot.  Worked okay.On day 3, I began getting complaints from callers about lag time.  The voice lags about 3-4 seconds, causing conversations to \"step all over each other.\"  Ooma\\'s response:  It\\'s a known problem and we hope users will continue to provide feedback so we can solve it.On day 4, callers began to complain that I always sounded as if I were on a very bad cell phone connection -- interference, dropouts, crackling, static, etc.  Ooma\\'s response:  Your internet service probably isn\\'t fast enough.  Since I have the fastest Internet service available from any ISP, clearly this is not the problem.  Ooma then acknowledged that yes, it\\'s possible the problem is theirs; they just like to have everyone check their ISP first.On day 5, extreme echoing was added to the list of call quality complaints.After debating for several days whether the very poor call quality was worth the very low price of using Ooma, today it again started to send all my calls straight to voice mail.  Checking the Ooma support forum, I see it\\'s happening to many users all over the country.  Obviously, another Ooma software problem.My choice comes down to great phone service with horrific customer support at high cost with the traditional phone company, or horrific phone service with helpful customer support at low cost with Ooma.

The DVD shred holder is a nice touch for those of us who are going to recycle the shredded paper. There is also a plastic guard that keeps the shredded paper from escaping the holder. This is attached to the shredder itself.I agree that this is top heavy, as most shredders are. The collection container is short, the taller the container, the more top heavy this would be.  At least it was designed right to avoid topples.I had the shredder on the automatic setting and shred for about 5 minutes.  Placed 5 sheets in and it bogged down and jammed the shredder.

I let it cool down but the shredder would no longer function.There was also an odor while I was testing this out. It smelled like a new blender does when being used for the first time.

The holder mounts with four glue backed velcro type strips (although they aren\\'t technically velcro - the strips are all the same - they work the same way. I was a bit taken aback when the instructions said to apply the strips first, then press it to the wall, then remove the device to press the mounting strips to the wall. I expected the wall side to pull away, but it worked. Anyway, be prepared for a couple of minutes of very fine print reading!Overall, if you need more desk space and there is a free vertical wall or filing cabinet nearby, this works well.

I like to write a note as I think about it so having something mounted to the wall and not being able to write on it (like a dry erase pad for example) doesn't help me.If I'm using a post it note, it's because I had a sudden idea that I had to remember and in the time for me to pull it out of the container and grab the pen, I've forgotten why I wanted to write something down.I was really disappointed in this product and won't be using it in the future.\",\n",

It sticks to your walls but can easily be removed. There's a spring inside the pop-up  holder which forces the pop-ups to the slot in the front, making it easy to use, no matter how many pop-ups you have.There are a couple of things that prevent me from giving it 5 stars. First off, I think the pen holder should have been designed better. It's a little bit larger in circumference than you would expect for a typical pen - which would be fine if the pen holder extended to the entire side of the pop-up dispenser. I think it's too easy for pens to fall out. Second  it's not that clear in the photos, but while most of the container for the post-it is white, the bottom, inside of the pen holder, and back of container is the color of the post-it note (in the bright blue, green or pink). I think it would have made more sense to have it all white so that you could easily change the color of the post-it note.\",\n",

So, to refill this you'll need to buy the right kind.)If you want to remove it at some point, you can, but follow the directions so you don't damage the surface. These tabs are pretty sturdy, though, so I do wonder if a matte-painted wall might still lose some paint. I haven't tried it because I'm not planning on removing the dispenser, however.The pen holder is short, perhaps allowing for easy pen removal should the dispenser need to fit in short spaces, but a standard pen dangles and sways, giving the appearance it may fall out. It won't, but I put a shorter pen in anyhow. (Pen not included.)I use these notes in the office and would like to have more desk space, so this will work out just fine.\",\n",

When I saw this wall-mount Pop-Up dispenser, that utilizes the 3M Command adhesive strips for instant removal that wouldn't damage my walls, I knew I found another item I had to have!  And the colors are so much more fun.  Mine is white with a turquoise backing.  The only thing that would have been better is if it came with the pen shown in the packaging that I can buy to go with it.  It is easy enough to provide my own pen to stick in the short pen holder, so I will not complain.I installed one inside my pantry, so that I can scribble quick notes-to-self about when I refilled a cereal or nut container. I try to keep track of how long it takes my family to use up stuff, so that I can be ready to buy more when I need to.  I don't like running out of things and having to scramble for them.  I also use those notes to write quick notes to put in my kids' lunch boxes.  They do like that sort of thing!This dispenser does only work with the Pop-up pads.  They dispense vertically.  You will notice the difference in how the pads are adhered together, sort of accordion-like, and not all on one end only like a pad of paper.  They sell these wherever regular Post-its are sold, just look carefully at the packaging.\",\n",

This little unit solves the problem by getting the dispenser off of the desktop. I attached one to a Rubbermaid mini-drawer unit where I keep writing implements, cutting devices, and small tools. No longer will I have to gently lift the edges of paper piles looking for the dispenser. A second one will find a home next to my chair in the TV room which will solve the problem of never being able to find either something to write with or to write upon when I want to make a note of something while watching TV or a movie.Note: a couple of the colors are a little cartoony and garish, but you can find Post-It pop-up refills in more subdued colors at most large office supply stores. I was an early adopter of 3M Command(tm) adhesives and learned a couple of things along the way: (1) make sure you leave enough space to both get a grip on the tab and pull out several inches if you think you will ever want to remove the item, (2) be very, very careful pulling out the Command(tm) strip, especially if the object has been adhered a few years - the strip can pull itself apart making it impossible to remove in the intended way.',\n",

The actual notes are those that fan out accordion style and that\\'s fine and appropriate as it works with the dispenser. The pen holder is extremely handy as don\\'t you often want to write a note at your house and not be able to locate a WORKING pen??? The only issue I ever have is that you have to pull the notes out of the dispenser and leave a leading edge so that you can grab a single \"note\" and then use it. You could leave the whole pad inside, but then you\\'d have to remove it from the dispenser in order to peel off a single sheet. So I just pull a couple of pages over the edge of the dispenser!Anyway, this is a great addition to the post-it line of office, school, and home products and I really like it.

May it be on the fridge, office wall, desk wall or anywhere you can think of putting the dispenser, for its ease of use and its price, it's definitely worth it.Dispenser holds about 90 Post-It notes and a pen, fastener strips are placed behind the device and can stick to these velcro strips (there are four strips included per dispenser). Pulling out the post-it notes are easy and because of the post-it notes weight is quite small, you don't have to worry about the strips falling off the wall.I did a test for removal of the dispenser from a wall to see if it leaves any bad residue and overall, if taken off correctly, there was no residue. Granted, this was within a day's time not several years, but I expect that removing the dispenser and its sticky tabs from a wall will peel off paint or leave permanent marks.So, overall this product is easy to use, it's cheap (especially if you are looking for something cheap to gain free shipping on Amazon) and perfect for what it was made for.\",\n",

This dispenser can be hung on a wall or other vertical surface, and allows one to pull out Post-Its in pop-up form.  There's also a space to store a pen.  So, this is quite a convenient little gadget, but there are some things to be aware of before purchase.  I'm not especially handy, and at first I couldn't figure out exactly how I was supposed to attach it to the wall.  I did manage to figure it out, but there aren't instructions, and the sticky velcro was not immediately obvious, at least for me.  The dispenser sticks to the wall with adhesive tabs that have velcro on one side, and are sticky on the other.  The velcro holds well, and can easily support the weight of the dispenser, and with use of a new tab, the dispenser can be moved.  That said, the package does caution that the adhesive can mar wallpaper, and I was a bit afraid of what it would do to my walls.  Thus, I ended up sticking this on the side of a file cabinet.  I can't say exactly what it will do to the walls because I'm not willing to try it.  At the end of the day, while this dispenser is certainly handy, I'm not convinced that it's so much more usefull than a desktop dispenser, which Post-It already makes.  I suspect that next to a wall phone this could be quite useful, but I don't think I'd go out of my way to upgrade if I already had another dispenser.\",\n",

One is either stuck with the provided digital voice or has to purchase voicemail.

If I turn off the answering system, the voice mail will pick up, but the phone will not indicate if I have any messages.  I get nothng from this phone that I could not get from any other two line phone without an answering system.The good qualities (although not enough to redeem it).  The phone will tell you who is calling on the other line if you are engaged on one and separate rings can be used for both lines.  That's about it.  I am very disappointed.\",\n",

       "       'This is the first time I had used a comb binding machine and I was terribly disappointed.  The machine itself seems well made.  Very solidly built and stable.  The thing is big and pretty heavy.  Takes up a lot of desk space and not easy to move around.  The swing arm for punching holes is very smooth and easy to move.  Holes are punched with minimal effort.  I did get a misaligned set of holes one of the times I used it.  I found it a little tough to use on not new paper where the endges may be slightly furled.  This made it harder for both punching holes and especially for loading on the combs.  At over $130, I think it is really quite pricey for a manual binder.  If you often need to bind a lot of documents or reports with lots of pages you probably want to get an automated puncher one (or go to a copy shop).  If you only have the occasional need then the cost becomes difficult to justify.  Especially since there are a number of other binders that cost well under $100.It is a very nice manual comb binder but, a bit pricey for the occasional or casual use.',\n",

It's small, has 3 sturdy binder clips and even has an inside pocket for pens, a calculator, a nail file, etc.  It's a great idea in theory.The problem is that unless I go to an office supply store, there is no common paper size that fits this.  I have short legal size notepads at home and without punching holes in the papers, it wouldn't work.When I tried to use this with the notepads I had, I misaligned the hole punch and had to deal with the messy rough edges from ripping the paper off the pad.  It's too time consuming, in my opinion, to find paper for this binder, punch holes in it and then load it into the binder - particularly when the end effect is it looks messy and disheveled.A more helpful way to market this product would be to have plenty of paper inside the binder, along with a note about what size paper to buy in the future.

When you get it be a little careful with the drawer, its jammed in there, feels a little fragile and is tough to get out. But with a little wiggling it comes right out. And seems better after a few uses.I have never found a non commercial gread shredder that wont get stuck on an envelope, no matter how thin it feels. This one is no exception. But if you open up first it will speed through it.My one issue is with the stack feature. I must be doing something wrong, but I have yet to get it to work through the whole stack without having to back it out a bit to get it to unjam. But that could be user error. Everything else works great, and for a paper shredder, it looks pretty good. In the past I've used a little bit of WD-40 to lubricate the shredding mechanism and will probably to continue to do so with this one. (Spraying a piece of paper and putting it though.) This model does recomend using their lubrication product, so use my method at your own risk.As long as your not expecting commercial grade, (and you shouldnt at this price) this is a great consumer or small business level shredder.\",\n",

As long as the papers are not wrinkled the tray with the stack will take about 60 pages. You no longer need to be present to shred a stack of papers. It's efficiency is also not hindered by staples-they shred, too. In comparison with other traditional manual, or upright shredders, this machine is extremely quiet. It fits on top of a filing cabinet very nicely, and we've also used it at home, for the piles of junk mail and other unnecessary mail in the house. The pull out tray of the tray also creates less mess than other upright shredders. The smoothness of the shredding combined with quietness makes the job of the necessary shredding in any home or office environment seem easy, quick and less intrusive. We love this machine.

It also shreds credit cards (one at a time).  It shreds documents fastened with staples (standard staples only, no heavy-duty staples, and only up to 25 stapled sheets at a time) and paperclips (small paperclips only, no large clips, and again only 25 sheets at a time).  It can shred paper, card stock, crumpled sheets, multiple folded sheets, and unopened junk mail - these are best shredded using the manual slot.  Besides heavy-duty staples and large paperclips, it cannot shred bound documents, bulldog clips, magazines, or other documents bound by multiple staples or clips, elastic sheets, laminated documents, plastic folders, glossy paper, or adhesive labels.Although I try to keep up with paperwork, there are times when my piles of shredding get overwhelming (old bank statements, old bills, etc.) and I am thrilled with the way the SWINGLINE Stack-and-Shred 60X Hands Free Shredder works.  Instead of having to constantly feed paper into the shredder, I can stack the paper, push a button, and walk away as the shredder does its thing.  I tried the shredder on a number of items - a stack of paper with exactly 60 sheets, junk mail, old bills, notebook paper - and it did an excellent job of shredding.  The fact that it crosscuts while shredding is another bonus and makes me feel even more secure about what I am shredding.  However, there are a couple of things I didn't like about the shredder.  It is slow - it takes quite a while to shred 60 sheets of paper.  And, since the shredder can overheat if used continuously for over eight minutes, (it has an indicator that will warn you if it is overheated) it can take a long time to shred a large pile of documents.  Also, the bin containing the shredded paper tends to fill up very quickly and it can be messy to empty when full.  Still, these are minor quibbles about a product that works very well.The SWINGLINE Stack-and-Shred 60X Hands Free Shredder, 60 Sheet Capacity does an excellent job.\",\n",
       "       \"All the shredders I had used until this one required manual feeding. The more expensive models allow you to feed more sheets at a time, but essentially whenever you have a stack of sheets to shred the process is always the same: estimate how many sheets you can push through at the same time, try it, jam the shredder, reverse, separate a mess of mangled sheets into two stacks, try to feed them again, deal with another shredder jam because the mangled stack went sideways and crumpled up... Aaaaargh!This Swingline stack-and-shred model is different: if you have a few sheets or a credit card to shred, use it like you'd use a normal shredder. A thicker stack (up to 60 sheets)? Open the lid, drop the stack horizontally, close the lid, and let the shredder work its magic. It will feed the sheets one by one until the stack is gone.The rest of the shredder is a very conventional 5 sheet cross-cut shredder with 4 gallon wastebasket drawer. The waste bin is made of clear plastic so you can easily see when it's time to empty it.If you regularly spend a lot of time feeding your shredder, the Swingline Stack-and-Shred is a no-brainer.

It generally handles the stack without human intervention and does so quietly and efficiently.  The shreds are fairly fine and collect neatly in the nicely designed clear bin beneath the top.  This shredder can also handle credit cards in a manual feed slot.  If you want to do any other kind of shredding, I would recommend you look elsewhere.  This shredder is designed specifically for neatly stacked paper.  As per the instruction manual--and as I've personally verified on numerous occasions (to my inconvenience and annoyance)--this shredder does not handle the following: more than 25 pages stapled (or held) together, multiple folded sheets, magazines, unopened mail, plastic sheets, thick paper or cardstock, or crumpled sheets.  Believe me, it will jam up if you try to pass any of these forbidden items through the shredder.

You can stack up to 60 pages for shredding and the unit feeds the paper into the shredder. Alternatively, you have the option to manually feed the shredder from  top feed. The machine is not too fond of staples. The manufacturer claims that staples can go through the shredder and that it can if you separate the sheets first. YMMV on staples but that was my experience. I should add though that many larger, more expensive, feeders also are staple shy - so I do not think that this is an issue with this shredder alone - but ore likely a comment on all shredders! I also really like the compact size of the unit itself. Easily fits under a desk - or on top of it. I am also pleased the noise level is about as minimal as these things can go.All in all I am very pleased with this shredder - it would be a perfect home, small business, studio or other place that does not require doing large amounts of shredding - although this little gem can handle mor than I thought it could !',\n",

After one day of use, I can tell that prolonged use would most certainly bring back my writers callous on my middle finger.I suppose it all depends on what it is you\\'re looking for in a pen.

They write fine, just like any other BIC, and I like having pens like this around because they tend to walk away with my kids.

So, I always try to buy pens whenever they are on sale.The front of the package that these Bic Cristal For Her Ball Point Pens reminds me of women's razors.  I like that these pens, the barrel is thinner, and this comes in a package of 16, which is great for a person like me who uses alot of pens.  Most packages of pens only come in packs of 10, unless you buy them at an office supply store. As a person with smaller hands these pens do feel better in my hand, as I kind of hold my pen tight in my hand.I also like that the barrels of the pens and caps are different colors, such as blue, green, orange, pink, and purple.  It's nice for alittle variety, even for such a common place thing like a pen.  To me it makes them look alittle more elegant.  You can clearly see how much ink is left in the pen, always a good thing to know.So many different things are made for either men or women, so why not pens?  Iam always on the lookout for things that are alittle unique, even if it is just a pen.\",\n",

You get 16 black medium tip pens in various blissful girly colors, such as pastel purple, pink, peach, and green.  The pens are thinner than the original Bic pen and I find it fits my hand very well, as well it just feels good. I handed out pens to a couple of co-workers and they enjoyed them too.  Seems women like having their own pen and expressing such living colors with just a hint of sparkle.  Grab these and you will love them.  Not for those with larger hands or fingers.  I find them best for smaller hands.',\n",

The sales person also lied this printer was smaller then my former printer as another sales point.The MX700 was far superior to this model, they have stripped the printer\\'s software interface of many of the great features the MX700 had forcing me to use computer settings for scanning that is often very time consuming and repetitive.  It used to be I could choose all the necessary features from the printer itself, but they reduced the choices and none of them work without adjustments on a computer.  It really stinks to high heaven, their engineers must be knuckleheads.This printer is a little slower then the MX700 and it\\'s bottom paper tray has less paper feed while they worked on improving their backside paper feed.  The improvements they attempted to make on this printer are all usefulness and illusory, nothing of any real value when you\\'re in a hurry and need a PDF scanned for a client to email.This is just a disaster printer, and believe me I was all ready to like it upon arrival.  It\\'s a piece of crap and I hate it so much I am going to have to repack it and have Canon pick it up.  It\\'s that bad.  I\\'m going back to HP now.

Instead you have to check off each one on a lame interface and save it to a folder it forces you to choose.1.  Canon has an additional black print cartridge to buy because they want to make money on their cartridges. Think of the added expense of having to pay for a large black inkwell and a smaller black well. Does that make any sense at all?2.  Canon did not improve the speed of the printer whatsoever, in fact it is even slower than the MX700. It\\'s scan feed is equally just as slow.3.  The design of this printer is also not very good, it\\'s really a very poor design of a round corner box, as compared to the slick MX700 style.They need to fire their engineer team who made this printer worse, not better, than the MX700.

       "       'The Epson software provided with this printer installs spyware on your computer in the form of the Ask.com toolbar without your knowledge.A few days ago I found that the Ask toolbar had been installed on one of my systems at a time when no one was at work or using the computers.  It took only a few minutes to find that the offending software was installed by the Epson printer software.  In fact it had been installed on all six computers in my office that had the Epson 837 printer installed.A look at the Add/Remove programs screen also revealed the following software: Epson Customer Participation, Epson Download Navigator, and Epson Event Manager.  All these programs communicate over the internet and all were apparently installed with the Epson software packageI am very frustrated with the endless task of trying to keep all the unwanted junk ware, ad ware, and spyware off my machines.I accuse Epson of sleazy business practices.  How about it Epson?  Have you no shame?  Have you no ethics?UPDATE 11/18/2013  After a recent install carefully choosing not to allow any internet access to the Epson Software, I got a popup from Windows Security Alert saying Windows Firewall  had blocked net access to EEventManager by SEIKO EPSON CORPORATION.  I chose to Keep Blocking the software.  Also got a popup from Epson requesting that I install the LTCM Desktop Client.  This is so called  \"non harmful\" spyware by Leader Technologies.  And yet another popup from Epson requesting that I become a part of \"a new research study to understand printer and ink use.  If you choose to help, your printer usage data will be sent anonymously to Epson.\"I now think I understand at least a part of why they are wanting to update firmware and track my ink use.  I found one person on the internet complaining that after Epson had updated their firmware the third party ink they were using no longer worked.I would very much like to know what others are observing about Epson\\'s behavior.===================================2/11/2014 UpdateI would not recommend this printer if you plan to use non Epson Ink.  Tried several brands with the two 837s that I own and none have performed for any length of time.  The Epson ink is very expensive.',\n",
       "       \"I thought I was upgrading to a better printer when I chose the WP-4540 to replace my 840. I think the printer that is half the price is a better printer.The wp4540 has two paper drawers but it's default setting is the paper loaded in the slot in the back, which doesn't hold 500 sheets. Itis annoying to constantly have to reload paper, especially if your set-up makes accessing the rear paper slot difficult.The printer does print very faint if you desire but double filled cartridges are available for the 840 so the cost of ink is about the same.The scanner is misaligned. Maybe I got a lemon but I can't put an image in the corner of the glass. It adds an extra step when cropping images.After about 3 months the yellow cartridge started leaking. I've never had a printer with a leaking cartridge before.There are more settings for different size papers for the wp4540 than the 840 but they aren't all available for the pre-programmed settings. I print on 8 1/2 x 11 sheets cut in half. I am not able to use this feature.For twice the price I got less than 1/2 the printer I was using.\",\n",
       "       \"The hardest part of setting up and using this printer was getting the old one out of the way so I had the room to start!Seriously.My two young teenaged boys pulled this out for me since I had procrastinated, and I observed as they spent about ten minutes getting everything put together (things like plugging in the cord and inserting the printer cartridges) and running the printing test.I spent maybe 5 minutes following the incredibly easy instructions to get the printer onto my network, and then we were able to print.  Flawlessly.  We have not had a single problem printing anything in the past two months.Double-sided printing (or copying) is so incredibly simple and far faster than I expected.  Making copies is intuitive.  Scanning is easy.The only thing we haven't tried is using it to fax... because that is just something we don't do.We can print from our Mac laptops, our PC desktop, the iPad, and my iPod Touch.  Everything has been simple and flawless.I love that this uses separate ink cartridges for the color, as that feels so much less wasteful.\",\n",
       "       \"I'm a big fan of the Epson all in ones and thought that a bigger capacity version would be great to replace my workforce 600, which is having clogged ink issues now. Upon delivery I was surprised to see how large this machine is. Compared to the WF600 its about double the size. For an inkjet machine, it is the size of a color laser printer and almost as heavy. I'm not sure why its so big, even with the higher capacity paper drawer I think it could have been designed smaller.Another issue I don't care for is the top paper feeder. I know this is a business printer so its designed for heavy use but, the WF600 has a nice folding design where this is completely open and I know it will gather dust quickly. I wouldn't rest any heavy things on the top of this as its all plastic and will surely crack. The big issue with this is the ink, the giant ink packs as i'll call them because they don't look like a normal cartridge (photo attached), they are $25.00 each for color and $38.00 for the black so to replace the inks it will cost $113.00. Although the new inks will be extra capacity, the ones it came with are starter inks and it says that on the stickers (initial cartridge).I'm using this with a mac and win7 and both work problem free. Setup was easy and adding it to my network was just as simple. The only issue I have is that the Epson Scanning software doesn't seem to work. It didn't work with the WF600 either so I have to use the mac image capture instead, no big deal. The printer is fast but not much faster than the WF600. Its just as loud too but not a big deal. And lastly, I think with this printers size it could have had a touch screen instead of the ancient up, down, left, right buttons.Pros:Large capacityExtra big inksFront and Rear loading paper traysWireless networkingDouble sided printingCons:SizeInk replacement pricesHeavyNeeds a touch screen\",\n",
       "       \"Please tell me what magic this contains to make the ink so expensive?  Unicorn horns?  Eye of newt?  How can we produce an entire netbook computer including all the components and the cost of the operating system for $199 yet can't make an ink cartridge for $10?  Disgraceful.\",\n",
       "       \"This may be a good printer/scanner/FAX/etc.  For all I know it may also mix bread dough and and exterminate unwanted critters. I have not evaluated its performance which I am counting upon to be at least adequate.However, what has got me riled is the problems encountered getting the thing hooked up and running. After a day of wrestling with the seemingly unlimited options for setup, and finding none that worked I was torn between three emotions: 1] making it work, 2] returning danged thing or 3] pounding it to rubble with a large hammer..So, proceeding with the most illogical emotion, 1, I called upon Geek Squad to come and do their magic. I got the distinct impression that the Geek Squad folks have a particular fondness for this printer because of all the jobs it creates for them. Anyway, by spending something like three times the price of the machine, it ended up working almost as advertised; even the Geek couldn't get the scanner to work on my Mac, but it does work on a Windows PC.I confess that I have only fooled around with computers and the stuff you hang onto them for about 30 years, and I have concentrated upon being a user rather than a fixer of them.  I also confess having become spoiled by so many nice products that integrate themselves into my system smoothly and without the need for much effort.  For instance, my PC, Kindles, iPad, and my next door neighbors all lock in on my wifi router by simply keying in my password; but this Brother printer required a lot of fooling around including changing the name on my wifi (making it necessary for all the other devices and neighbors to have to find it and put in the password again.If you enjoy puzzles you might get a real kick out of this machine.  Otherwise, I recommend that unless you are very knowledgable about such things, look elsewhere for your next printer.\",\n",
       "       'This printer is a great black and white printer.  It prints quickly with hardly any wait for it to startup.  It also is very quiet when printing, making little noise.  This is a great printer to use for just everyday printing or making numerous copies.  Also is a fax machine.  The only problem is that it does not include a cable to hook to you computer.  My box had the copier, a phone line, CD, and instruction book.  The first thing it asks when you put the CD in is to hook the printer to the computer but if you dont have a cable your out of luck.  So I had to order one seperately and wait for it to come in before hooking the machine up.  I was only out a couple bucks but for that price and because it is needed it should be included in box.',\n",
       "       'I go through a lot of printers. For what I do, I generally don\\'t need a fancy printer, and you can always pick up a bargain printer for less than the cost of ink (or toner) for an existing printer. Some are good, some not so good, but none has been any problem until this thing.My biggest complaint is that after sending a job to the Samsung printer, my computer will not go into \"sleep\" mode. It just hangs at the \"Preparing to stand by...\" screen. I uninstalled the original Samsung software, did a system restore, got the latest driver, and still the problem persists. The problem ONLY occurs after using this Samsung printer. This is completely unacceptable. This printer has just achieved \"boat anchor\" status.Other annoyances:The Samsung printer software (installed from the boxed CD) hijacked my Print Screen key for some \"easy capture manager\" nonsense. I do not appreciate so-called \"easy\" software that changes the way my computer works without so much as a \"by your leave\".Prints of grayscale images (photos, shaded objects, etc.) have horizontal lines that shouldn\\'t be there, showing that the toner is not distributed evenly.The manual feed slot is a bad joke. There is nothing to support the paper, so presumably you\\'re supposed to stand there and hold it until the printer starts taking it in. No matter how I try to adjust the side guides, the paper does not feed straight, giving me trapezoidal shipping labels.I agree with another reviewer in regard to removing the output slot cover. It serves no purpose other than to create paper jams if you forget to open it before printing. Too bad you can\\'t move it down to the manual feed slot; it would make an ideal support for the paper there.No printed manual; browser-based user manual complains that my default browser is not Internet Explorer. Also, pages are too wide for a standard 1024-pixel-wide display. Dumb glitches from a \"name\" brand.Stay far away from this one!',\n",
       "       \"Come on Xerox, in this day and age you would think manufacturers would not completely ignore the entire Mac community but that's what we have here. At least Amazon has updated the information on the scanner to include this information, but I'm still surprised that this scanner has ZERO Mac support. No drivers, no software, zip. Other Xerox scanners have Mac support (albeit pretty crappy support at best) so why is this one, which is targeted more for the home and small business markets where Macs are more common completely without it?So since I can't use it on my Mac, I installed it onto my Windows Virtual Machine, and started trying it out. When it works, the performance is great. The speed of this machine is impressive! It zips through documents so fast you won't believe it. I love the duplex feature as well, this is a big time saver when scanning two-sided documents. It does tend to jam a bit more than I would like though and often double feeds, or even grabs all the papers and tries to feed them through. If you are planning to scan mostly business documents that are in perfect condition and relatively thick paper, you may not have too much trouble with this. When I tried to scan documents that were fairly thin paper though, I could expect pretty frequent jams and feed problems. It's very easy to pop open and unjam, and you can configure it so you can refeed and continue to add pages to the same document where many scanners you have to start all over (at least in theory...in practice I often found I had to start over).The software is very full-featured but not terribly user friendly, the interface is very cluttered and confusing, and you've got a few different programs to deal with and they don't always play well together, nor is it always obvious which one to use for what. There's no printed documentation to refer to, so you're having to jump back and forth from the PDF to the program to try and figure stuff out. I couldn't for instance, figure out how to get the scanner dialog for duplex scanning to come up in the software that did OCR, so ended up having to scan in one program, and then doing OCR in another. Really cludgy. I often had to try a couple times to get the right quality when saving files as it seemed to default to low quality most of the time which is not likely to be what most people want, this is definitely not a software package for the average home user that just wants things to be easy and not have to go reading manuals to figure stuff out. Problems using the OCR as well. I feed it a simple 2-page document with large clear text, but it just froze up on the second page. On a second try, it went through okay and the results were okay but the program still kept trying to OCR the first scan and eventually locked up so bad I had to reboot Windows. This is why I try to stick with stuff that runs on the Mac! I've had quite a few crashes of the software over the months of using it, most of the time just restartng the program does the trick but it's not unusual for it to kill Windows completely.Scanning color documents in particular was a major problem, I do have some groups I work with where my copies of their triplicate documents are color papers that just doesn't show up well when scanned in greyscale. I had HUGE problems with this scanner when trying to scan a pile of these papers. It would routinely get about halfway through and then the problems would start, locking up, throwing errors, often requiring me to pull the plug on the scanner to get it working again, and usually having to reboot Windows completely as once it failed, there didn't seem to be any way to get the scanner driver to run again. Very very frustrating. I had a pile of about 40 of these color papers to get scanned and took me a couple HOURS to do what should have take 10-15 minutes, with all the lock-ups, reboots, restarting the scanner, etc. failure for it to load the document after it was scanned, etc. I even tried another PDF program to see if the Xerox software was the problem but seems to be a driver issue, it just cannot handle multiple color documents being scanned (my VM has been allocated 3 Gig of RAM and I have nothing else running so plenty of memory for this task available). So if you work with color documents at ALL be warned, this scanner (or the software and driver) has serious problems with color documents in bulk. I won't even bother using it again for anything more than a few color pages, it was such a complete failure.I did really like the software that lets you configure the buttons on the scanner to do specific types of scans and then convert to PDF and save to a specific folder, but it took a lot of fiddling with it to get things to work, and it was annoying how it only runs in the tray and you have to mouse over and activate it just the right way to get into the settings. I did wish there were a few more options here as well, for instance, to add a password to the PDF, and again, the lack of Mac drivers/software made it impossible to have it open or save the PDF on the Mac side as I wanted, and meant more work for me to accomplish my scans. I usually end up doing most of my scanning without this feature do to not being able to do everything I want, but when I need a quick, fast scan, for instance if I need to do an e-Fax, it's a nice time savings over not having this feature at all. It even included a plugin to save the file to Evernote, which I use heavily...but again, the lack of PDF settings to password-protect the file made this of limited use to me, and I pretty much never use it as a result.Overall, the scanner hardware is excellent when it's working. I love how compact it is, and easy to store away. I did seem to have jams more frequently than I would like, and the device is annoyingly hard to turn off (you have to press and hold the power for several seconds and there's no indication of if you have held it long enough) but the compact size, duplex feature and scanning speed make up for these minor nits. I just am not happy at all that it won't run at all on Mac, and much of the software included is really kludgy and not at all easy to use. Even if just looking at the experience using it in Windows, I'm not blown away. It just crashes and fails way too often, particularly for non-business documents that may not be perfectly flat (and I don't mean these are crumpled, messed up papers, they just aren't pristine!) and particularly with color documents. The price is pretty high, so I really expected it to do better. It's a shame as the scanner itself is really nice. But the software so buggy it's hard to recommend it as a result.\",\n",

I was a little afraid that it would show up against white paper but it does. There are playful crytal clickers at the top of the pen. There are hexagon crystal like decoration as an added touch to the body of the pen.I am not sure that the clip is necessary as women don't usually put pens in the pockets of their blouses.Pink is pretty but not very useful, I would suggest tourquoise instead.Over all the pens are very pretty and very comfortable to hold.

The barrel diameter is slightly larger than the usual with an inward curved rubber piece where your fingers grip near the nib.Because you are dealing with a ballpoint, the ink flow is not smooth and you will have to bear down a bit harder than usual when writing.A lightweight adequate ballpoint will get the job done and will look good sitting out on your desk.

What I love most was the pink and purple ink - the ink color is bright and eye-catching. The ink is smooth with no clumping and the pen is lightweight with a great rubber grip to make writing comfortable. I also like that they are retractable since pen caps have a tendency to get lost and therefore, dry out the pen.

Several of us agreed that it was nice to have pink and purple inks that were not hard on the eyes to read, my biggest complaint with most inks in those colors.

I like girlie cutsie things, but I\\'m not 12 and I think a bit more sophistication would be in order for this line.

       "       'To quote from Gilbert and Sullivan: \"An insult, but a light one.\" So why make a fuss about BIC\\'s \"gender-specific\" attempt to sell a good pen?  To begin with, many modern women are offended at being \"characterized\" (more often, stereotyped) on the basis of gender.  As we\\'ve learned from much feminist thought (excluding some more recent psychoanalytic French women theorists who became influential after Simone de Beauvoire\\'s seminal \"The Second Sex\"), there is no \"essential\" difference between female and male consciousness. Hence, male authors such as James Joyce (Molly Bloom\\'s monologue, occupying the last third of \"Ulysses\" and, perhaps above all, William Faulkner (Addie Bundren, \"As I Lay Dying,\" and Rosa Coldfield, \"Absalom, Absalom!) have represented the consciousness of female characters in comprehensive, penetrating, surgically precise prose/poetry that, at the least, matches the same authors\\' male characterizations. Consequently, Bic\\'s pitch of what should be a gender-neutral product to a female audience is unlikely to meet with a warm reception in academe, especially since the 1970s. \"Essentialism\" is a nemesis if not a dirty word many Western feminists would expunge from all discourse about gender differences.  Just look at the patronizingly patriarchal discourse of the Republican Party during the present Presidential campaign: male candidates for high office are talking about \"legislating women\\'s right to choose\"--in the 2nd decade of the new millennium!Still, even a feminist (and I don\\'t exclude myself from that number) need not take serious offense at Bic\\'s attempt to win women\\'s favor.  Despite the flowery, Victorian, dainty colors (they\\'re anything but garish), this is after all not a \"fine\" but a \"medium point\" pen.  Moreover, the barrel is surprisingly solid and large.  It\\'s grip-friendly for the largest hands (and perhaps for some smaller ones).  The diameter is noticeably thicker and more rugged than the popular Bic Atlantis pen.  In fact, the barrel of this pen is bigger than any other ballpoint--Papermate, Pilot, Bic--in my large collection (I\\'m addicted to ballpoint pens and am especially fastidious about things like grip, flow, smoothness).One feature I did not realize until using this pen is that the colorful \"flowery\" barrel is not merely decorative: it indicates the color of the ink.  I had no idea that I would not merely be seeing red and violet on the pen but inscribing notes in those same colors.  So the BIC Her Fashion gets a \"high five\" for any ball pen users seeking alternatives to the universal, predictable, potentially bland and boring blue and black ink of most ball points.There\\'s some initial resistance in getting the pen to loosen up and move freely, but after several minutes it was literally sailing through my stationery, leaving in its wake refreshing colors that I have no doubt some correspondents will relish as much as I.  If you\\'re a male, open up to the wisdom of all cultures concerning gender. The yin and the yang, the anima and the animus are not mutually exclusive.  We all have--in our chromosomes and genetic make-up--psychological, emotional, and physical traits normally associated with the \"other\" sex.  And admitting to those traits can be a healthy exercise in self-examination as well as promotion of better understanding of what we as human beings have in common.So, go on--pick up two packs of these pens and share them with your male friends.  By employing the pen, men can at once congratulate BIC on a good product DESPITE--not because of--its  steretypically feminine adornments.',\n",

They are a sturdier build than other ballpoint pens, more like what I would expect from a rollerball or gel pen.  I found the quality of the ink and the writing experience to be variable. The purple pen/ink writes very smoothly and clearly; the pink pen/ink is very draggy.  That\\'s good news for me as I could see myself using the purple ink but really have not had use for a pink pen in 30 years :-)',\n",

What differentiates printers these days is ease of connection over wireless networks. This printer fails.To connect over a WiFi network, you must push two buttons-one of the printer and one on the router. This means you cannot have the router in one room and the printer in another, unless you have a faithful assistant to punch at your command. The directions on how to accomplish this are confusing as well. And what if your router or office network do not have a button to push? Well, you know the answer, your printer will be powered like mine off a USB cable.The second major problem is what I call the cheap problem. The initial toner is inadequate.

I thought I was simply missing the drivers since the product description never mentions this limitation, but when I emailed Ricoh customer service, I received the following reply: &#34;This model does not support Post Script Print Language that Apple requires. There are no drivers available for the Mac OS. Thank you for choosing Ricoh. &#34;I am truly disappointed- I would never have ordered this heavy, bulky printer if I had known it would not work with my Mac.  The product description really needs to be updated to mention this limitation.\",\n",

       "       \"I was really surprised when I received the Cannon IX6820. The box it came in was much larger and heavier than I anticipated. And once I opened it, I found so was the printer. I expected something more streamlined. This is not a compact job it is a large size but it handles a multitude of prints ranging from small to very large.But though it prints nicely and make those g-normous size prints, the big drawback is it does nothing else. It does not fax. make copies, etc. It is a one feature only machine that simply copies. Now personally, I do work from home and have several printers, but I like them to all multi-task so if one fails I can use another. Many people do not have the space or desire to have multiple machines. So this for many would not be the best choice.And then there is the matter of price point. At the price it is, it is much higher than a number of machines that perform a variety of functions. Why didn't they make it so it could multi-task?Despite the crisp, clean prints the other short comings i.e. being a one trick pony is just not the best value for the money in my opinion.\",\n",
       "       'First, I\\'ve had no problems with the accuracy of this scale. I have two other scales with which I test weighed the same three objects (370 gram can of soda; 8 pound dumb bell I use to work out; and an Android table I had laying around). All three objects weighed the same on this scale and the other two. In fact, my dumb bell weighed in at 8 pounds 2.5 ounces on all three (my dumb bell is obviously heavy). So, I didn\\'t formally calibrate the scale, but if used as directed on a flat surface (same directions for ALL my scales by the way) it consistently gives the same readings and agrees with my other scales. One of my comparison scales checked out to the 1/10th of an ounce with my local official US Post Office kiosk scale, so I\\'ll stand behind the accuracy here, AT LEAST to 1/10th of an ounce (2-3 grams).I am definitely a fan of the external display. I often weigh packages that obscure scale readings on those where the display is on the unit itself. I have mounted the display, which folds out flat, on the wall behind this scale. I don\\'t often have to move the unit, but the display just pops off the wall when I do have to do that. The visibility of the display is a VERY bright blue and another plus. I\\'m betting this may result in faster battery use over time, but that\\'s not really an issue for me. This DOES come with an external \"wall wart\" power supply so you could use that if buying batteries bugs you.I find I don\\'t use the external power supply as it\\'s just an extra thing in the way, and rely upon the two AAA batteries this unit uses. So far, no problems after a couple of weeks, but I can\\'t speak as to how long they\\'ll last.I checked the cable attaching the display unit to the scale itself and verified that it is NOT a standard telephone cable. If you want to replace it with a longer one you\\'ll have to do some homework. I\\'m pretty sure this is a standard cable of some type, but for me its length is fine.The scale does what it says it does and the description is accurate.Sample product received for review purposes.',\n",
       "       'The Smart Weight ACE110 has two sections. The 8\" x 8\" weighing platform can placed on the floor while the readout can be set on a counter or mounted on a wall for easier viewing. It operates on either 2 AAA batteries which are included or the included AC adapter can be used to save battery life.This scale has both a HOLD function & a TARE function.The TARE function zeroes out the container to ignore the weight of the container and weighs only the item inside the container.The HOLD function  holds the weight on the display after the object has been removed from the scale.Read the manual for instructions on using these functions.The weight appeared quickly & was consistent. However, when compared to two smaller scales I own, this postal scale continually weighed items approximately 1/10 - 2/10 of an ounce less than the other scales.  Although this isn\\'t much, I deducted one star for this.The scale has been calibrated at the factory; however, calibration instructions are given if you need them.This is a good scale which weighs items quickly, consistently & has a TARE function as well as a  HOLD function. The readout is separate from the weighing scale. The scale is portable and can be carried to the object being weighed. It has 4 weighing modes (lb, oz, kg & g) and weighs items ranging in weight from .1 oz - 110 lbs.Included in box:Weighing display/readoutWeighing scale, 8\" x 8\" platformCoiled cableAC Adapter2 AAA batteriesUser ManualLimited 10 Year Warrantyreview sample provided',\n",
       "       \"I use shipping scales a lot and have used them for a while. At home (currently, a USB scale) and at work (a postage meter), so I am very familiar with them. I ship a lot of items and I am looking for something that is easy to use and accurate. I know what I am looking for and what I expect in a scale. This one somewhat my expectations.The scale has 4 components: the scale, the 'computer monitor', the AC adapter and an expandable telephone cord.  It has a 8x8 platform and the display is about half the size of the platform. I connected the display to the platform and proceeded to test it out against another scale. The scale provided accurate and consistent readouts.What I do not like about this scale is that it is in 2 parts. The computer display part is in the way, all the time. I wish they had added something so that it could attach to the scale, a small bracket or something. Having the computer move around and slide out every time I was dealing with packages was a bit annoying. Also, I don't like telephone or extendable cords. They wrap around stuff, they tangle with everything else. A better option would be a retractable cord. Or, no cord at all; attaching the readout to the scale would be better.The Smart Weigh ACE110 postal scale has a 110lb capacity, which I of course tested. It looks sturdy and well made. It has 4 weight modes: lb / lb:oz / kg or g. It has convenient Tare and Hold modes.This is an accurate and consistent scale and I recommend it if you are not nitpicky about the issues I mentioned.*Sample provided for review.\",\n",

       "       'A few months after my previous review where I said things like: \"This is the easiest assembly project I\\'ve ever had to do. The bottom section is already assembled, so it\\'s simply a matter of putting the constructed seat and back onto the legs and you\\'re done. The arms are the only part that you really have to put any effort into assembling, and it really takes a matter of a minute to do that.\"-or-\"This is the most comfortable chair I\\'ve owned. It\\'s soft without being too soft, it matches my lumbar area perfectly. That said, the back is springy and that\\'s where I start to get concerned. The plastic construction doesn\\'t seem like it\\'s going to be something that lasts years, especially if this chair gets hours of use every day. It\\'s meant to be a flexing back to adapt to your movements, but I think enough weight/pressure could weaken the plastic and cause it to snap. I can\\'t guarantee this, but I plan to keep an eye on this and will report back if I notice the narrower parts of plastic showing any signs of weakness.\"I updated the review with:\"I had previously rated this chair four stars, however, I feel the need to come in and update the review. Two days this week, Vermont had some heat and humidity. Nothing oppressive, but it was humid. The dark blue pad on the seat back of this office chair is apparently glued on. I got up this morning to find that blue pad lying on the chair seat The glue loosened and now that pad no longer stays affixed to the chair back. For an inexpensive chair, I would likely expect that. This really isn\\'t an inexpensive chair, however, so I\\'m a little surprised that that pad is simply glued into place. I can get Gorilla glue and fix it myself, but I won\\'t hide my disappointment that this happened on a chair I hoped would be more rugged than it looks.\"I\\'m back about month later. The plastic of the seat back and the plastic coating on the back of the padded cushion just don\\'t stay adhered, even with Gorilla glue. My husband offered to use his rivet gun next, but it seems to me that is a lot of work for a chair with that kind of MSRP.',\n",
       "       \"The handset of this phone is impressive, possessing a slender, efficient, comfortable design with clear voice transmission and reception through the unit.  Note, however, that the phone is a single unit with a built-in answering machine and doesn't come with expansion handsets.All in all, the phone is fine, but surprisingly no-frills in the ringtone department, offering less than ten options . . . and none of them are anything about which to rave.  Furthermore, the ringer volume seems to max out at a less-than-desirably-loud volume.  My less futuristic Panasonic phone/answering machine (with 2 handset extensions) has oodles of ringtone options for each handset and the ringer can be made quite loud.

       "       \"1st Update: FedEx picked up the following day.My policy upon receiving an electronic product for review: Set it up. Start it up. Install it. Test it in every way I can.I received the 'Epson WorkForce WF-7620' all in one printer, used the quick set up while the included CD contacted servers for drivers and such, and connected to my WiFi. The printer display stalled on the last digit of the year while on my monitor I was asked to print a page, I indicated yes, and that was the end of it. The response was that the inks weren't ready. I tried reinstalling everything which didn't help.Unable to find anything of help online at the Epson website I resorted to calling their service department. After about 5 minutes I  connected with a service tech. who, after a bit of testing, determined the printer would have to be replaced but I'd have to take the defective unit to a FedEx facility to be returned.At this point I balked. I've this printer defective out of the box and I have to repackage this huge and heavy machine and somehow get it to a FedEx facility which is miles away. Why? Now, I understand Epson isn't alone with this policy as other sellers also expect it and get away with it. Could it be because they've already been paid upfront and the purchaser is out the cost, and without a printer. This policy, although common practice, shouldn't be allowed. Of course, I received the printer for the purpose of review, and explained that to the svc. tech's. supervisor. Also, I made it clear that my review would include my experience with the service department. All told a little more than an hour of my time was spent on the phone and with initial testing on my own. And it turns out Epson would have FedEx pick up the unit.Both the Epson service tech. and her supervisor were friendly and receptive and I expected Epson to do the right thing. Of course they weren't in a position not to. But, I also expect to hear from Epson regarding their policy and if I'll receive another printer for the purpose of review. I'm truly disappointed as I so wanted to make a comparison between Epson and Canon printers. I should report that I'm very familiar with and have reviewed more than a few printers, other than Epson, without experiencing an iota of trouble.I'll update this review if and when a circumstance changes.\"], dtype=object)"

       "array([ 'We have been using a previous version color laser multi-function,Brother MFC-9970CDW Color Laser All-in-One with Wireless Networking and Duplex, for several years now and have been fairly happy with it. This most recent upgrade offers a few welcome new features, but also retains some of the same flaws from the MFC-9970.First and foremost, this thing is huge, even slightly larger than the 9970, which was already a behemoth. This is about twice the size, both in width and height, as a standard laser printer and perhaps three times the weight. If you\\'re using this in a home office scenario, as we are, make sure you have the room ... And help to lift it to wherever you plan to install it.Seriously, it\\'s B-I-G check out the dimensions and measure before buying; this thing takes up more than half an average desktop.Other than physically moving the thing, install was simple. We\\'re an all Apple household and I never use included printer software. I did all the unpacking--mostly a myriad of tape removal--plugged it in and used the touchscreen to connect to my wifi network, which was simple and easy. Then I went on my MacBook Pro, used the add printer option and the Brother popped up immediately. Within about five minutes of plug-in I was printing, which is awesome.To set up the other features is also fairly easy, though may require a bit more investigation of the instruction book, to, for example, set particulars for your phone system if you\\'re sharing a fax and voice line. Even with those caveats it wasn\\'t more than 15 minutes total, and the ability to get a test fax from Brother to makes sure your set-up is correct was much appreciated. (I know fax is antiquated, but I work from home and you\\'d be amazed how often it\\'s still needed for sending/receiving various signature documents to clients.)Like previous Brother MFC printers, it appears that scanning only works when the printer is connected via USB and, since it\\'s not a feature we use much, so I haven\\'t bothered to even try to test that out yet. (If I\\'m wrong about needing to be hard-wired to scan, please let me know. I\\'d love to be able to use this feature without running a wire the few times per year it would come in handy.)As for print and copy quality, I\\'ve found both black and white and color prints crisp and more than acceptable with my previous color laser MFC and, if anything, they are better here, not to mention noticeably faster. A graphic-heavy color page may take a bit longer, but not extraordinarily so, and while you won\\'t want to use this, or any color laser, for photo printing, it\\'s perfectly acceptable for even intricate page proofs, which I use it for regularly.Black and white prints and copies, as well as those with just some color, are super speedy and the sheet feeder works very well for both copying and faxing, with only rare jams as long as you stick to full-size, standard letter sheets. Odd-size copying and faxing can easily be done from the glass, which also works smoothly. You can also copy or fax from the sheet feeder even if you\\'ve accidentally left something on the glass, without incident, unlike some other MFC models.The downfall, again, as with the previous version--and something I\\'d sincerely hoped was improved here, but sadly isn\\'t--is that auto-duplex for either copying or printing works pretty poorly. Yes, it can, theoretically, automatically print or copy to two-sides, and the feature isn\\'t hard to select via print menu or touchscreen ... It\\'s just that in actual practice it doesn\\'t work well. At all. Frequent and hard to clear paper jams, and constant overheating, particularly if you\\'re trying to print color to two sides, plagued every duplex print job I attempted.A 10-page PDF, for instance, printed 10 one-sided copies flawlessly (that\\'s 100 sheets), quickly and without incident. When I tried to print the same PDF 10 times as a duplex document, the printer bogged down before it even finished the first copy, and stopped three more times with jams and heat issues before it even got to copy 5, with several ruined pages that would have required re-dos anyway. When a \"clear jam and leave machine to cool down 10 minutes\" message suspended my attempt once again, I just gave up. I\\'d love to be able to save space and paper, but the duplex feature here just isn\\'t robust enough to rely on.In terms of toner life and replacement of the four toner cartridges used--black, cyan, magenta and yellow--I\\'ll add my biggest caveat(s) ... I can\\'t comment on longevity here since I\\'ve only been using it a day, but I will say I\\'ve had very good luck with toner life in my previous color laser MFC, and have no reason to suspect it will be otherwise here. Yes, replacement cartridges are extremely expensive and Brother, like most printer makers, uses sensors that will force early changing of cartridges which still contain usable ink (do a Google search for \"Brother toner reset menu\" to find a few safe ways to over-ride that, at least temporarily) AND also purposely foul their machines with proprietary sensors to attempt off-brand cartridges from working. It\\'s a sleazy tactic but, frankly, I don\\'t know a maker who doesn\\'t do it, so it\\'s an industry-wide issue.I\\'ve also always used non-Brother replacements without incident until recently, when an Amazon-purchased ink set (see:4 Pack (BK C M Y) Toner Cartridge for TN-315 Brother MFC-9460CDN MFC-9560CDW MFC-9970CDW HL-4150CDN HL-4570CDW) reacted poorly with my MFC-9970s sensors, eventually resulting in bricking of a perfectly good, and very expensive, printer. I would say the blame lies in both the cartridge maker (not that the Amazon Marketplace seller in that case assumed any ... but that\\'s a rant for another review) AND Brother for being so greedy in trying to prevent customers from using non-OEM options.Basically, the cartridge sensor \"confused,\" or \"fouled,\" or \"voided\"--various Brother phone techs used all three words--the toner cartridge sensor, thus making the machine totally unusable. Since it didn\\'t recognize a toner cartridge as installed, it wouldn\\'t work, at all. And the \"fouling\" part is that even after removing the offending cartridge, the sensor still malfunctioned, thus making the machine unusable. I spent hours on the phone, with three levels of customer support, doing various resets and trying other tricks, and all came to the result that the only option was to return my very heavy, one-year-old printer and hope it could be fixed, all at my expense, with no guarantee of cost or warranty of the repair actually working. Long story short, that\\'s why I\\'m no longer using the 9970. (NOTE: While the toner cartridge install method and physical shape looks the same it appears that this L8850 printer does use slightly different toner cartridges than the MFC-9970.)The moral of that story is be careful what toner cartridges you use and don\\'t always just bet on the cheapest option (or, in my case, ever buy an off-brand printer product with zero reviews at the time) because sometimes you get what you pay for with shoddy quality that could result not only in unusable ink, but damaged equipment. I know, I know, just like the printer makers always warned you--and I was previously one to poo-poo those claims as money-grubbing and fear-mongering ... Right up until it happened to me. Sigh.Anyway, the best new feature I\\'ve seen on this model, besides the improved menu on its larger touchscreen, is its ability to work with Air Print. Previously, they offered a Brother print app, but it was clunky and didn\\'t interact with most apps you\\'d actually want to print from. Air Print just plain works and with basically zero set-up, other than selecting the device on my hardware.  I was printing from both my iPhone 5s and iPad Air wirelessly. Very cool and quite useful. No more emailing myself screenshots when I need to print something I have on my phone. Awesome.To sum up, this is a solid office-quality machine. It performs more than adequately as a copy machine, making up to 100 copies with ease and clarity, fax and laser printer, outputting high quality prints in good time. The touchscreen makes the menus easy to access and walks you through each step of the set-up and printing. The wireless access is rock solid and works even when it\\'s on a separate network from, say, my laptop. It\\'s easy to set-up and relatively intuitive to use. And the addition of Air Print is a significant upgrade if you\\'ve got Apple goodies. The major downfalls, besides needing to be aware of its bulk, are the buggy duplex printing and toner cost, the latter of which is an issue for every printer I\\'ve ever had.',\n",

       "       'This is an interesting concept - jot down your notes on this pad, take a picture on your smart phone (the special symbols on the 4 corners of these pages are supposed to \"clean up\" the image by properly aligning it) and save it to Evernote and similar note-taking apps.  However, the execution is sub-par for the following reasons:- Paper - The lines are printed only on 1 side so you cannot really write on the back of each page.  The paper is quite thin so those who enjoy using fountain pens or even some wet gel pens will see bleedthrough on the back of the page.  I used relatively dry-writing extra fine Lamy Safari (with Waterman Havana Brown ink) and extra fine Hero (with Noodler\\'s Black ink) fountain pens and they both showed bleedthroughs.- App - the free app that you can download from the iTunes store is mediocre at best.  When I turned on the camera, there is no indication of whether I had the right angle/zoom.  Additionally, the app is supposed to export the image to my Evernote account.  Even after asking me for authentication, it was unsuccessful in exporting the scanned image to Evernote.  I do not see the advantage of the special symbols as the scanned picture still showed them and the ugly lines.  Why bother with these expensive pads when you can just get a regular pad without the special symbols and use the Evernote app to scan take a picture????  Same results but far cheaper.For those who likes digitizing their notes, there is a better option.  There is a Swedish notebook maker called Whitelines (products available on Amazon) that takes the same concept but executes it far better.  Their Whitelines LINK notebooks have a very light gray background and white lines with the special scan symbols on the 4 corners.  They have an app in the iTunes store that automatically scans the page when it \"sees the special symbols\" and automatically uploads it to Evernote, Dropbox or your email (you check off your choice at the bottom of each page).  Unlike the Ampad app, you don\\'t waste time and effort wondering whether you have found the perfect distance/angle to take a scan.  Then, depending on which box you select at the bottom of the page, the app will automatically deliver your scanned image to Evernote, Dropbox or email.  For those who want a free trial before buying these notebooks, you can get FREE paper templates on the Whitelines website to try it out before committing to the notebook!  Lastly, the paper for the Whitelines Link notebook is fountain pen friendly so you do not have to worry about bleedthrough and you can write on the back of each page.  One last thing, the gray background/white lines combo will \"disappear\" with the scan so you get a nice white background and just your handwriting without distracting lines!  How cool is that!*Note, the regular Whitelines notebooks do not have special symbols for scanning so buy the Whitelines LINK notebook to digitize your notes.',\n",

I read the Panasonic manual carefully. I even managed to successfully transfer my phone list from my cell phone via Bluetooth. I think there is something malfunctioning with this phone.  I have given up. The only reason I'm giving it a 3 Star rating is because it worked properly for a few days when I first got it. I have spent far too many hours trying to get it to work, so I am reluctantly giving up. I'll ship it to my PhD daughter to see if she can do any better.When it did work, it was very clear and without any significant background noise. I strongly prefer to use this Panasonic cordless phone versus my Nokia smart phone which radiates from 300 to 600 milli-Watts of microwave energy into my brain. (Slight digression: I avoid putting cell phones against my ear as much as possible for this reason. I always try to use Bluetooth headsets or cordless phones like this Panasonic Bluetooth to cordless phone adapter. I've seen recent verified reports that brain tumors have been linked to excessive cell phone use. So far the tumors have been benign; however, time will tell. Cell phones are a relatively recent invention and it takes a long time for this sort of thing to show up in our brains. It may be the reason I have a pituitary brain tumor.)\",\n",
